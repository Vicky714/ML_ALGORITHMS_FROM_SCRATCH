# ML_ALGORITHMS_FROM_SCRATCH
This repository contains implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms built from scratch using "NumPy", without using any high-level ML libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
The goal is to understand the core math and logic behind each algorithm by building them step-by-step as a beginner wouldâ€”starting from scratch with clear variable naming and explanations.

# What's Inside
# Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Bernoulli)
- Decision Tree (using Information Gain)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network (1 hidden layer)
  
# Unsupervised Learning
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering

# Structure
Each file focuses on "one algorithm" and includes:
- Code implemented using basic Python + NumPy
- Comments for educational clarity
- Example datasets for testing (e.g., Iris, synthetic datasets)
